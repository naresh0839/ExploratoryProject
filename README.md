## Link Prediction in Complex Networks (Exploratory Project)

> This repository contains the code, dataset and project report for an exploratory project based on the topic "Link Prediction in Complex Networks" done under
the guidance of Dr. Bhaskar Biswas in the Even Semester of Session 2020-21.

# Project Report

> In this report we cover the Theory for Link Prediction, first defining the problem. And then in the next section, we describe the process of Dataset preparation and information of Link Prediction Algorithms. In the next section, we provide the results comparing the various algorithms and
conclusions in the end to finally conclude the report.

# Declaration

> The work contained in this report is original and has been done by us our self and in the general supervision of our supervisor Dr. Bhaskar Biswas. Whenever we have used materials (data, theoretical analysis, results) from other sources we have given due credit to them by citing them in our project report.
